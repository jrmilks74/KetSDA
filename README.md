A Shiny dashboard displaying the weekly online audience and in-person attendance at Kettering Adventist Church, Kettering, Ohio, USA. The dashboard has three tabs. The first shows the combined numbers, the second shows the numbers for only the contemporary service, and the third shows the data for the traditional service. Within each tab, the data is broken down in to combined audience, online-only, and in-person only. All data is now kept on Google Sheets, allowing the dashboard to pull in new data as soon as the respective Google Sheet is updated.
